// roleFuzzyMatch over-matched whenever the token overlap dominated the
// SMALLER side: two distinct roles sharing a long prefix ("Full-Stack
// Engineer 5, AI Insights & Visualizations" vs "Full Stack Engineer 5, Ads
// Reporting") or a brand token (#751: "UberEats Feed" vs "Consumer
// Fulfillment (UberEats)") collapsed onto one tracker row — silently

// Tier-2 (entry num + company): pins the TITLE FIELD ONLY (#2166 review).
//
// The title-preservation guard keys on reportNumMatched, which only tier-1
// (report number + company) sets — so tier-2 preserves the existing title too.
// That is intentional: tier-2 fires only AFTER tier-1 failed, i.e. the addition
// carries a report link that did NOT match the row's while the bare num did.
// Report-file numbering and tracker-row numbering drift independently, so a
// tier-2 hit is "these two numbers coincide at this company" — a coincidence,
// not an expressed intent to retitle. Since date/score/report/notes are all
// overwritten unconditionally on the update path, the title is the only field
// left carrying the evidence that two reqs were distinct. This test exists so a
// future refactor cannot flip that behavior silently.
//
// SCOPE — read before extending this test. The fixture below is a deliberately
// pathological isolation case, and the row it produces is internally
// inconsistent: the preserved title describes one req while the overwritten
// report link points at another req's evaluation. That inconsistency is
// PRE-EXISTING tier-2 behavior, not something this change introduces — before
// the guard, the same collision overwrote the title as well, which loses
// strictly more information (the tracker no longer records that the original
// req was ever applied to). This test therefore asserts ONLY that the title
// survives; it does NOT endorse the rest of the merged row as correct. The
// underlying question — whether an uncorroborated num+company collision should
// update in place at all, versus adding the row or surfacing a conflict — is a
// tier-2 redesign, deliberately out of scope for this #2165 bugfix.
