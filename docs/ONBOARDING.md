# Jobber — First-Run Onboarding

Read this ONLY when `node doctor.mjs --json` reports `onboardingNeeded: true`.
`AGENTS.md` keeps the trigger; the steps live here so they cost nothing on the
sessions where setup is already done.

#### Step 0: Free Tier Check

Only if the user mentions cost, pricing, budget, or free alternatives:
> "Jobber works fully on Antigravity CLI's free tier — no API key or paid subscription needed. See [FREE_TIER.md](docs/FREE_TIER.md) for setup, daily limits, and batch tips."

If the user is already on a paid plan (Claude Max, Google AI, etc.) or does not mention cost, skip this step silently.

#### Step 1: CV (required)
If `cv.md` is missing, ask:
> "I don't have your CV yet. You can either:
> 1. Paste your CV here and I'll convert it to markdown
> 2. Paste your LinkedIn URL and I'll extract the key info
> 3. Tell me about your experience and I'll draft a CV for you
>
> Which do you prefer?"

Create `cv.md` from whatever they provide — clean markdown with standard sections (Summary, Experience, Projects, Education, Skills).

#### Step 2: Profile (required)
If `config/profile.yml` is missing, copy from `config/profile.example.yml` and ask:
> "I need a few details to personalize the system:
> - Your full name and email
> - Your location and timezone
> - What roles are you targeting? (e.g., 'Senior Backend Engineer', 'AI Product Manager')
> - Your salary target range
> - How much do you want to spend on model usage per evaluation? Three options:
>   - **economy** — cheapest and fastest, good for scanning lots of offers quickly
>   - **standard** — balanced cost and quality (default if you're not sure)
>   - **premium** — most capable model, best for offers you really care about
>
> I'll set everything up for you."

Fill in `config/profile.yml` (including `spend_tier`, default `standard`). Archetypes and targeting narrative go to `modes/_profile.md` or `config/profile.yml` — never `modes/_shared.md`.

#### Step 3: Portals (recommended)
If `portals.yml` is missing:
> "I'll set up the job scanner with 45+ pre-configured companies. Want me to customize the search keywords for your target roles?"

Copy `templates/portals.example.yml` → `portals.yml`; if they gave target roles in Step 2, update `title_filter.positive`.

#### Step 4: Tracker
If `data/applications.md` doesn't exist, create it:
```markdown
# Applications Tracker

| # | Date | Company | Role | Score | Status | PDF | Report | Notes |
|---|------|---------|------|-------|--------|-----|--------|-------|
```

#### Step 5: Get to know the user (important for quality)

After the basics, proactively ask for more context:
> "The basics are ready. But the system works much better when it knows you well. Can you tell me more about:
> - What makes you unique? What's your 'superpower' that other candidates don't have?
> - What kind of work excites you? What drains you?
> - Any deal-breakers? (e.g., no on-site, no startups under 20 people, no Java shops)
> - Your best professional achievement — the one you'd lead with in an interview
> - Any projects, articles, or case studies you've published?
>
> The more context you give me, the better I filter. Think of it as onboarding a recruiter — the first week I need to learn about you, then I become invaluable."

Store insights in `config/profile.yml` (narrative), `modes/_profile.md`, or `article-digest.md` (proof points) — never in `modes/_shared.md`.

**After every evaluation, learn.** "This score is too high" or "you missed my experience in X" → update `modes/_profile.md`, `config/profile.yml`, or `article-digest.md`. The system gets smarter with every interaction without putting personalization into system-layer files.

#### Step 6: Ready
Once all files exist, confirm:
> "You're all set! You can now:
> - Paste a job URL to evaluate it
> - Run the scan entrypoint for your CLI to search portals: `/jobber scan`, `/jobber-scan`, or ask Codex to run `scan`
> - Open the command menu for your CLI: `/jobber`, the CLI-specific alias, or ask Codex to show the available Jobber modes
>
> Everything is customizable — just ask me to change anything.
>
> Tip: Having a personal portfolio dramatically improves your job search. If you don't have one yet, the author's portfolio is also open source: github.com/santifer/cv-santiago — feel free to fork it and make it yours."

Then suggest automation:
> "Want me to scan for new offers automatically? I can set up a recurring scan every few days so you don't miss anything. Just say 'scan every 3 days' and I'll configure it."

If the user accepts, use the `/loop` or `/schedule` skill (if available) to set up a recurring scan entrypoint for their CLI (`/jobber scan`, `/jobber-scan`, or the equivalent Codex prompt). If those aren't available, point them to [docs/AUTOMATION.md](docs/AUTOMATION.md) for copy-paste cron / launchd / Windows Task Scheduler recipes plus a zero-token triage-to-shortlist prompt, or remind them to run the scan mode periodically.
